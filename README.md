# About me

My previous professional experience wasn't too close to IT, but I am that inquisitive person who's trying to find out why things aren't working as they should. I want to start my testing journey and I'm pretty confident that my conscientiousness and precision will let me join this part of IT world. Despite my age I am a quick learner and I want to develop myself professionally
